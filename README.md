# Universal UGC (User Generated Content) Contributions Management System

The `uugc` library is a Deno module designed to facilitate the management and
validation of User Generated Content (UGC). With the power of Zod, it offers
strong type validations for entities related to UGC. The module simplifies the
process of storing contributions, making them hierarchical, and provides both
in-memory and potentially other persistent solutions.

We call it _Universal_ UGC (`UUGC`) because it can be used for a variety of
use-cases such as commenting system (e.g. blog comments), forum messages,
real-time chats, sync'ing with Discord, LinkedIn, Slack, Teams, etc.

## Features

- Strongly typed entities using Zod.
- In-memory persistence strategy for quick prototyping.
- Extensible design to accommodate other storage solutions.
- Hierarchical representation of contributions.
- Asynchronous methods simulating real-world scenarios.
- Simple rendering logic for contributions.

## Architecture

### Concepts

- Persistence, User Interactions, and Presentation are separated
  - Persistence should mutate and persist entities in as small and granular
    "flat" way as possible (as opposed to "rich JSON" with hiearchical
    structures) so that contributions may be easily stored in memory, in
    Key/Value databases, in relational databases, or in document databases --
    making the persistence truly independent. When retrieving data from the
    database, though, the in-memory structures should be "rich" and
    hierarchical.
  - User Interactions should be decoupled from Persistence so that whether we're
    using an HTTP service, GraphQL, web sockets, a wire protocol (like
    PostgreSQL), or any other service interface our persistence is not tied to
    UI/UX/service activities.
  - Presentation services should be decoupled from Persistence and User
    Interactions so that we can serve HTML, Mobile, and other user agents.
- Use Zod for defining and inferring types for entities like Parties,
  Contributions, and their relationships so that user-supplied content can be
  parsed and validated before persisting or interacting or presenting.
- Uses asynchronous methods whenever reasonable.

### Entities

- Party: An entity which can be a Person or an Organization.
- Contribution: User-generated content with optional parent linking, making it
  hierarchical.
- Contribution Target: The target entity to which a contribution is related.
  This could be a URL for a content (e.g. a blog post comment), it could be
  another thread (in case one message is a reply to another like in Discord,
  etc.).
- Contribution Session: Represents user activity with authentication and user
  agent details.
- Contribution Reaction: a `like` or other reaction to a contribution.
- TODO: Contribution Folksonomy: tagging and other organizing capabilities.

### Persistence Strategies

- ContributionSessionPersistenceStrategy: Interface defining CRUD operations on
  authenticated sessions.
- ContributionPersistenceStrategy: Interface defining CRUD operations on
  contributions.
- ContributionTargetRelationshipPersistenceStrategy: Interface defining CRUD
  operations on the relationship between contributions and their targets.

### Interaction and Presentation Strategies

- ContributionInteractionStrategy: Interface defining methods for posting and
  fetching contributions (this is the "business logic").
- ContributionPresentationStrategy: Interface for rendering contributions and
  threads (this is the "presentation logic").

### In-memory Implementations (mainly for demonstrations and examples)

- ContributionMemoryPersistence: An in-memory data store and CRUD implementation
  for contributions.
- ContributionTargetRelationshipMemoryPersistence: An in-memory data store and
  CRUD implementation for contribution-target relationships.
- TypicalContributionInteraction: A class implementing both interaction and
  presentation strategies. It uses in-memory stores by default. Provides
  rendering logic to represent contributions in a simple string format (for
  debugging).

## Init after clone

This repo uses git hooks for maintenance, after cloning the repo in your sandbox
please do the following:

```bash
deno task init
```

## Check for missing deps

```bash
deno task doctor
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
Git dependencies
  ðŸ†— .githooks/pre-commit
  ðŸ†— .githooks/pre-push
  ðŸ†— .githooks/prepare-commit-msg
Runtime dependencies
  ðŸ†— deno 1.34.0 (release, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
Build dependencies
  ðŸ†— dot - graphviz version 2.43.0 (0)
  ðŸ†— java 17 2021-09-14 LTS
  ðŸ†— PlantUML version 1.2022.6 (Tue Jun 21 13:34:49 EDT 2022)
```

Doctor task legend:

- ðŸš« is used to indicate a warning or error and should be corrected
- ðŸ’¡ is used to indicate an (optional) _suggestion_
- ðŸ†— is used to indicate success

If you get any error messages for `dot`, `Java`, or `PlantUML` then you will not
get auto-generated entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).

### Maintain Deno dependencies

You can check which deps need to be updated:

```bash
find . -name 'deps*.ts' -type f -not -path "./support/*" -exec udd --dry-run {} \;   # check first
find . -name 'deps*.ts' -type f -not -path "./support/*" -exec udd {} \;             # update deps
```
